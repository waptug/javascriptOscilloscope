Playing around with sound in javascript.

Run this code in a test server to play with sound.

This code displays a simple system to produce various sound wave types.
Sine, Square, Triangle, sawtooth. 
frequency from 40 Hz to 20K Hz
Volume from 0 to full controled via sliders and drop downs.
index.html is a simple sine wave
sound.html has better controls and more wave types
scrollwheelsound.html has partial mouse wheel event trigger.... to control frequency. 

@ToDo  get better wheel control and add arrow controls for fine grain control of sliders.
